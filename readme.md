#Readtable-Macro Transducer-Chain Parsing

This repository contains an implementation of a framework for using the readtable-macro transducer-chain (RMTS) parsing method.

This is described in the following three blog posts:

 * [Lexing I: the off-side rule](https://bloff.github.io/lyc/2015/08/02/lexer.html).
 * [Lexing II: readtableâ€“macro parsing](https://bloff.github.io/lyc/lexing,/syntax/2015/08/30/lexer-2.html).
 * *[Parsing via chains of tree-transducers](http://bloff.github.io/lyc/blog/drafts.html)* (yet to be written).
